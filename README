High-performance cryptography for the JVM

  Native implementations of a number of cryptographic primitives using
  optimized instructions such as AES-NI and PCLMUL available on recent
  x86-64 CPUs. Specifically this library provides:

    * AES in CBC, CTR, and GCM modes
    * AES + HMAC-SHA2
    * AES + SHA3 (Keccak-MAC)

  Additionally included are routines for generating cryptographically
  secure random bytes via the RDRAND instrution and fast constant-time
  array comparison using SSE2.

Usage

  The goal of this library is to provide secure, high-performance
  cryptographic primitives using a simple non-JCE interface:

    Cipher cipher = Crypto.cipher(AES, CBC, key, iv)
    cipher.encrypt(bytes, len)

  Authenticated encryption:

    Cipher cipher = Crypto.cipher(AES, CBC, key, iv)
    cipher.authenticate(SHA2, 256, key)
    cipher.encrypt(bytes, len)
    byte[] mac = cipher.mac()

  Secure random bytes (requires CPU supporting RDRAND):

    Crypto.bytes(iv, len)
