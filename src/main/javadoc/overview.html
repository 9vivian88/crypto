  <a href="http://github.com/wg/crypto">crypto</a> provides a simple Java interface
  to native cryptographic acceleration instructions available on recent x86-64 CPUs.
  Specifically this package supports AES in CBC, CTR, and GCM modes, authenticated
  encryption using HMAC-SHA2 or SHA3, and secure random byte generation using the
  RDRAND instruction.

  <p>
    {@link com.lambdaworks.crypto.Cipher} is a low-level interface to crytographic
    primitives and requires the user to have a thorough understanding of their
    correct usage with regard to initialization vectors, block cipher padding, etc.
